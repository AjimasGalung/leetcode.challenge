# leetcode.challenge
In this repo, I will share a lot of challenge from a different competitive website programming. One of my 
favorite website is LeetCode. LeetCode allows me to enhance my programming skills as well as problem solving and logical thinking skill.
Everytime I learn a new algortihm and data structure, I apply it to LeetCode. LeetCode also allows me to just focus on spesific skills
that you want to hone. For example, you want to improve your coding skills in array category. It is possible by using LeetCode. So, that's why I am
really excited to share all my answer in here. My concern in using LeetCode is that it trains my logic and problem solving a lot. 
Next, I do not only share from leetcode, but also from another website such as codewars or hackerrank.
